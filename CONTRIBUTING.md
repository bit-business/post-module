### Reporting an issue

Before submitting an issue you need to make sure:

- You are experiencing a concrete technical issue with Skijasi.
- You have already searched for related [issues](https://github.com/nadzorservera-croatia/skijasi/issues), and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it from your post).
- You are not asking a question about how to use Skijasi or about whether or not Skijasi has a certain feature. For general help using Skijasi, you may:
  - Refer to [the official Skijasi documentation](https://skijasi-docs.uatech.co.id).
  - Ask a question on [github discussion](https://github.com/nadzorservera-croatia/skijasi/discussions).
- Your issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.
- You can and do provide steps to reproduce your issue.
- You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right application started.
  - Make sure the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) is respected.
  - Make sure your issue body is readable and [well formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
  - Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` or `vendor` directory, meaning:
    - that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` or `vendor` folder
    - that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: `$ rm -rf node_modules && npm cache clear && npm install`.
